# Visualizing PML of the five-punctured sphere

### From the PML Visualization Project (http://dumas.io/PML/) by David Dumas and François Guéritaud

This repository contains:

* [```samples/```](samples/): __Code samples__ shown in lectures about
the PML visualization project, which illustrate various steps in the
computation and rendering process (while omitting certain efficiencies
and details to make the code simpler).  The current version was
prepared for [PyCon 2017](https://us.pycon.org/2017/).

* [```demo/```](demo/): A complete __demonstration__ of the computation
and rendering process used to create the images of Thurston's
embedding that are featured in the PML visualization project.


## Requirements

For the code samples:
* [Python 2.7 or 3.5+](http://python.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (tested with v1.11.0)

For the demonstration:
* [Python 2.7 or 3.5+](http://python.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (tested with v1.11.0)
* Posix shell environment
* [POV-Ray 3.6+](http://www.povray.org/) (only required for rendering)

## Quick start

See the README in [```samples/```](samples/) or [```demo/```](demo/)
as appropriate.
